## Overview

This GitHub project contains the C++ source code for the ShapeGen 2-D vector graphics library. The library is lightweight and highly portable.

ShapeGen draws both filled and stroked shapes. Shape boundaries (paths) of arbitrary complexity are constructed by connecting lines, Bezier curves (quadratic and cubic), and circular and elliptical arcs. Boundaries can contain holes, have disjoint regions, and self-intersect. Clipping regions can be defined with the same flexibility as shape boundaries.

The appearance of a stroked shape (path) is controlled by the following attributes:
* line width
* dashed-line pattern
* line-join style
* line-end cap style
* miter limit

The libraryâ€™s rendering code provides antialiasing and alpha blending, and can fill shapes with solid colors, tiled patterns (2-D textures), linear gradients, radial gradients, and conic gradients. Arbitrary affine transformations can be automatically applied to patterns and gradients.

Some 2-D graphics libraries achieve portability by sitting atop a portable graphics library such as OpenGL. Or perhaps they run on Cairo, which in turn runs on PixMan. The resulting dependencies complicate the build process and create bloated executables.

The ShapeGen library code has only two dependencies. The library requires
* a C++ compiler
* the Standard C Library

To achieve portability, ShapeGen draws directly to pixel memory, with absolutely no reliance on intermediaries to do the actual rendering.

Of course, an operating system such as Linux or Windows does not allow an application program to draw directly to the on-screen memory for a windowed display that is shared with other applications. To run in these systems, a small amount of platform-dependent code is required to copy an image to on-screen memory after ShapeGen has finished rendering the image.

All such platform-dependent code in this project is isolated in the source files `winmain.cpp` and `sdlmain.cpp`. These files enable the example ShapeGen-based applications in this project to run on the [SDL2 API](https://wiki.libsdl.org/) in Linux and Windows, and on the Win32/GDI API in Windows.

This project's two example applications are
* a demo program (`demo` or `demo.exe`) to show off the graphics capabilities of the ShapeGen library
* a simple ShapeGen-based SVG file viewer (`svgview` or `svgview.exe`) for viewing standalone SVG files (with `.svg` filename extensions)

These applications require a true-color graphics display, and run in a 1280x960 window. Make files and step-by-step instructions are provided for building all three platform-specific versions of these applications.

Minimal effort is required to port the ShapeGen library to a system whose graphics display device has limited color capabilities and does not support true-color pixel formats. For this type of system, a simple renderer is sufficient. This renderer consists of only a few lines of code and does only solid-color fills, with no antialiasing or alpha blending. 

A renderer is not required to do clipping. All shapes are clipped before being handed off to the renderer.

For more information, see the _ShapeGen User's Guide_ (the `userdoc.pdf` file in the project's main directory). This document explains key concepts, provides a comprehensive API reference, and contains many code examples. These code examples are also included at the end of the ShapeGen demo program.
